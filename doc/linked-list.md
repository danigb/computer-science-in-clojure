# Linked list

Linked lists provide extremely efficient insertion and deletion at the head of the list. These operations are O(1). Additionally, inserts and deletes into the middle of the list can be performed in constant-time provided a reference is kept to the node proceeding the node to be operated on, otherwise this is an O(n) operation. Inserts and deletes at the end of the list can also be performed in constant-time if the last element is known by some reference.
